Even though it is apparent that CS has a higher % of A's in recent years as compared to STATS, we see their Overall percentages being pretty similar.

It may be a case of Simpson's Paradox, as there could be other factors that tie in. For example, the types of courses that people with a heavy course load are taking. I would want to consider factors such as course levels and such, this will tell us if such rigorous students find the ideal party size to be larger or not."
